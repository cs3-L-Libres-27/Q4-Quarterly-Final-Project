                    <h2>What is Immunology?</h2>
                    <p>Immunology is the branch of biology and medicine that studies the immune system, the body's defense mechanism against infections, diseases, and foreign substances. It explores the complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to recognize and neutralize harmful pathogens like bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Through understanding immunology, scientists and doctors develop vaccines, treatments for autoimmune diseases, and therapies for allergies and immunodeficiencies, advancing our ability to protect and enhance human health.</p>

                    <h2>What does Immunology focus on?</h2>
                    <p>Immunology focuses on the immune system's role in maintaining health and combating disease. This scientific field delves into how the body identifies and eliminates harmful invaders, as well as how it remembers these threats to provide long-lasting protection. Immunologists study the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying immune responses, contributing to innovations in vaccines, cancer immunotherapies, and treatments for immune-related disorders, ultimately aiming to improve disease prevention and patient care.</p>

                    <h2>What does Immunology study?</h2>
                    <p>Immunology is the scientific study of the immune system, a vital component of human health responsible for defending the body against infections and malignancies. It investigates how immune cells detect and respond to pathogens, the development of immune memory, and the regulation of immune responses to avoid excessive inflammation. Insights from immunology are crucial for developing new vaccines, understanding autoimmune conditions, and creating targeted therapies that enhance the body's natural defense mechanisms, thus playing a pivotal role in modern medicine.   </p>
