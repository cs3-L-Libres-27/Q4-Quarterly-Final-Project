                    <h2>Human Immune System</h2>
                    <p>Immunology delves into the complex workings of the body's defense mechanism, known as the immune system. This system comprises a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to identify and eliminate pathogens, as well as to recognize and neutralize harmful substances. Immunologists investigate the intricate processes involved in immune responses, from the initial detection of foreign invaders to the subsequent activation of specific defense mechanisms.</p>

                    <h2>White Blood Cells ( WBC cells )</h2>
                    <p>White blood cells, also called leukocytes, are instrumental in the immune system's functions. Lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, include B cells and T cells, which play crucial roles in adaptive immunity by producing antibodies and orchestrating targeted responses against pathogens. Phagocytes, another category of white blood cells, engulf and digest foreign particles, aiding in the removal of pathogens and debris from the body. These specialized cells patrol the bloodstream and tissues, actively seeking out and neutralizing threats to maintain the body's health and integrity.</p>

                    <h2>Vaccinations</h2>
                    <p>Vaccinations are a cornerstone of modern medicine, offering effective protection against a variety of infectious diseases. They work by introducing weakened or inactive forms of pathogens, or fragments of their proteins, into the body. This exposure triggers the immune system to mount a response, generating antibodies specific to the pathogen without causing illness. Upon subsequent encounters with the actual pathogen, the immune system recognizes and swiftly eliminates it, preventing or mitigating the onset of disease. Vaccinations have been instrumental in eradicating or controlling numerous infectious diseases worldwide, contributing to public health and saving countless lives. </p>
